I have decided to make this portfolio to sort out all the projects I have participated in, and showcase them.

Today has been my 3rd year of work since I graduated ; it feels like it isn't long but a lot of things have happened in 
this amount of time.

After coming home from Shanghai in spring of 2016, I decided to settle in Strasbourg - the place where I was born.
I had desperately tried to work in a startup near Changping Rd, but unfortunately the law in China didn't provide 
foreigners with a work visa unless they had a minimum of two years of full-time work experience.

In Strasbourg I then found a job as Consultant, first for Econocom and now for Capgemini. I traded my web skills for the
Java JEE universe, a language I am familiar with considering I spent most of my studies playing with it.

I still love doing stuff on the web though as I've been coding websites and crawlers with various frameworks during my
two-year stay in China.
