<p>I'm specialized in the development of Java JEE apps as well as REST APIs. I have an experience in Web integration and
services' virtualization.</p>
<p>Having worked in China and Canada for a total of 2 years, I have a certain drive for the unknown.</p>
<p>Be curious, ambitious and keep challenging yourself. I love analysing code and meeting people around the world with
    exciting stories to tell. </p>
